We will solve tasks from 'Yandex intensive' competition.

**Yandex tasks**
1. We need to relize power iteration (also known as the power method) in 'PowerMethod' folder.
2. In the task of derivatives we are gonna write class of loss derivatives ('DerivativesOfLoss' folder).
3. We are gonna build a class for Laplace distribution in 'LaplaceDistribution' folder.
4. In exercise for 'KNearestNeighbor' folder we are gonna write efficient, vectorized code. We will work with the handwritten digits dataset. Images will be flattened (8x8 sized image -> 64 sized vector) and treated as vectors.
5. Folder 'BaggingRegressor' contains simplified version of BaggingRegressor from sklearn.
6. In folder 'BoostingRegressor' we are gonna write simplified version of BoostingRegressor from sklearn.
