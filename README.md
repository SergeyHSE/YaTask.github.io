We will solve tasks from 'Yandex intensive' competition.

**Yandex tasks**
1. We need to relize power iteration (also known as the power method) in 'PowerMethod' folder.
2. In the task of derivatives we are gonna write class of loss derivatives ('DerivativesOfLoss' folder).
3. We are gonna build a class for Laplace distribution in 'LaplaceDistribution' folder.
