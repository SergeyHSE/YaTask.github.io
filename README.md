We will solve tasks from 'Yandex intensive' competition.

**Yandex tasks**
1. We need to relize power iteration (also known as the power method).
2. In the task of derivatives we are gonna write class of loss derivatives.
3. We are gonna build a class for Laplace distribution in 'LaplaceDistribution' folder.
